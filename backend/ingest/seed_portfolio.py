"""Synthetic portfolio generation — DR-1.

Builds 8 fictional cedents, 24 treaties and their exposures, matching the
Firestore data model in `REQUIREMENTS.md` section 4.1.

**Deterministic and idempotent.** A fixed seed means re-running produces
byte-identical output, so the demo, the tests and the benchmarks all see the
same portfolio. Nothing here reads the clock or the network.

**Synthetic by rule** (C-8). Every cedent is fictional, every treaty is
invented. Company names are checked for collisions against real insurers as
part of S9; the fictional-name check is a release gate, not a habit.

The Sakura Cat XL programme (T-001 / wording W1) reproduces the
`DOMAIN_PRIMER.md` worked example **exactly** — layers 20 xs 10, 30 xs 30,
40 xs 60, premiums 2.0 / 1.5 / 1.0, Lion Re shares 25% / 10% / 0%. It is
pinned by `test_sakura_programme_matches_the_worked_example` and by the loss
engine's QA-1, because the money moment is computed from it.

Writers are pluggable: `write_json` needs nothing, `write_firestore` takes a
client. S1 runs on JSON alone, so no part of the data build blocks on GCP
access.
