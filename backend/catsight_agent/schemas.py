"""Pydantic schemas — REQUIREMENTS section 6 and REQUIREMENTS_V2 section 2.

These are the contract between the agents, the tools and the API. Two reasons
they are Pydantic rather than dataclasses:

  * `TreatyTerms` is passed to Gemini as `response_schema`, so the model
    returns structured output directly instead of JSON-in-prose that has to
    be salvaged;
  * every agent output is validated before it reaches the next stage, so a
    malformed field fails at the boundary that produced it rather than three
    stages later in the report.

Money is `Decimal` here as it is in the loss engine, for the reason given
there: the split case's `7.85 - 0.525` is 7.324999999999999 in binary float,
which rounds to the wrong cent. `model_dump(mode="json")` renders Decimals as
strings, which is what Firestore and the SSE stream should carry - a float
round-trip would reintroduce the error this avoids.
