"""QA-3 / B3 — field-level extraction accuracy against the answer key.

Scores extracted treaty terms against `ground_truth.json` and produces the
number that goes on the results slide. Pass bar: **>= 95% field accuracy**.

The harness is deliberately independent of *how* the extraction happened. It
takes `{treaty_id: {field: value}}` and knows nothing about Gemini, so it is
fully testable now and will produce a real number the moment a live extractor
exists. Nothing here changes when GCP access lands.

## Comparison is typed, not textual

`"72"`, `72` and `72.0` are the same hours clause; `["WS", "EQ"]` and
`["EQ", "WS"]` are the same peril list; `0.25` and `0.250000` are the same
share. A string compare would fail all three and report an accuracy far below
the truth, which is the sort of error that makes a team loosen a threshold
when the extractor was right all along.

Equally, `72` and `96` are not the same, and neither are `"JPN"` and
`["JPN"]` where a scalar was expected - so coercion is narrow and explicit
rather than best-effort.

## Citation pages are scored separately

QA-4 scores citation page accuracy at >= 95%, and it is reported on its own
line. A field extracted correctly but cited to the wrong page is a different
failure from a misread value: the number is right and the audit trail is
wrong, which in a regulated setting is arguably worse. Averaging the two
would hide both.
