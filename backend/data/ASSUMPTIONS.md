# Modelling assumptions

Every assumption the engine makes, with its source and how it gets validated.
CLAUDE.md requires this file to be updated as part of the change that
introduces an assumption, not afterwards.

The UI's Methodology page (UI-9) renders from this file. Nothing here is a
result; results live in `benchmarks/results/RESULTS.md`.

**Status key** — `SOURCED` published figure, cited · `DERIVED` follows from a
sourced figure or from the spec's own arithmetic · `JUDGEMENT` our choice,
defensible but ours · `UNVERIFIED` placeholder pending validation.

---

## 1. Money and arithmetic

| # | Assumption | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | Money is `Decimal`, not float, quantised to 6 dp | DERIVED | Binary float evaluates the split case's `7.85 - 0.525` as 7.324999999999999, which rounds to 7.32 rather than the correct 7.33. FR-LOSS acceptance requires exact matches, so float is unusable. Asserted by `test_float_arithmetic_loses_the_split_cases_tie`. |
| M2 | Money rounds **half away from zero** | JUDGEMENT | The financial convention. Python's built-in `round` is banker's rounding, which sends a true 7.325 down to 7.32. |
| M3 | Portfolio currency is USD; FX is fixed and configurable | JUDGEMENT | `JPY_PER_USD=150`, `PHP_PER_USD=56`, `TWD_PER_USD=32`. Fixed rather than dated, because the portfolio is synthetic and a moving rate would add noise without adding realism. |
| M4 | Figures are in USD millions throughout the worked example | DERIVED | From `DOMAIN_PRIMER.md` section 4. |

## 2. Reinstatements and reinstatement premium (FR-LOSS-3)

| # | Assumption | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | `RIP = (limit eroded by that occurrence / limit) x premium x rate`, **per occurrence**, pro rata as to amount, while reinstatement capacity remains | DERIVED | Derived in `docs/MONEY_MOMENT.md` section 4.1 by working backwards from the one-event figures the primer already publishes (our RIP 0.622, net 6.82). It is the only basis that reproduces them. |
| R2 | Reinstatement applies to **partial** erosion, not only to exhaustion | DERIVED | L2 is eroded 81.33% in the one-event case and still attracts RIP of 1.22 in the primer. An exhaustion-only rule would give zero. |
| R3 | Erosion beyond available reinstatement capacity is **paid** (if aggregate cover allows) but attracts **no** RIP | JUDGEMENT | Nothing is restored, so no reinstatement premium is due. This is what makes the split case's L1 RIP 2.00 rather than 2.94. |
| R4 | Aggregate cover per layer is `limit x (1 + reinstatements)` | JUDGEMENT | Standard. Exceeding it is an error, not a silent overrun. |
| R5 | RIP is due in the one-event case even though L1 is never drawn on again | JUDGEMENT | The primer charges it, which is consistent with automatic reinstatement on loss. Some wordings do not. Flagged for a practitioner in `MONEY_MOMENT.md` section 4.5 — it changes no figure in the demo, because both readings there have subsequent exposure. |

**Explicitly rejected**, with reasons in `MONEY_MOMENT.md` section 4.3:
RIP on *aggregate* ceded (charges 1.47 reinstatements where one exists) and RIP
sized by what the *following* occurrence draws (sizes the reinstatement by the
wrong occurrence).

## 3. Occurrence splitting (FR-LOSS-5)

| # | Assumption | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| O1 | A window opens at the first loss not yet assigned and runs for the clause's hours | JUDGEMENT | Standard wording lets the cedent elect the start but not before the first recorded loss. |
| O2 | A loss belongs to the window in which it **first occurs** | SOURCED | *UnipolSai v Covéa* (English Court of Appeal, 2024): "occur" means "first occur". |
| O3 | Windows may not overlap | SOURCED | Standard Cat XL wording. Falls out of O1 structurally. |
| O4 | Each occurrence carries its own retention | SOURCED | `DOMAIN_PRIMER.md` section 5a. |
| O5 | The 54.4 → 35.0 + 19.4 split is illustrative | JUDGEMENT | Taken from the primer as an example. In production the split derives from the event's loss timeline; whether a cedent would elect *this* placement is a judgement call flagged in `MONEY_MOMENT.md` section 4.5. |

## 4. Hazard — wind (DR-4)

| # | Assumption | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | Intensity at a centroid is the **maximum** over all track points | JUDGEMENT | Per DR-4. A region brushed early and struck later takes the worse of the two. |
| W2 | Radial profile is piecewise linear through RMW, R64, R50, R34, then zero | JUDGEMENT | Per DR-4. A crude but transparent substitute for a parametric wind field. |
| W3 | Quadrant radii are averaged over **reported quadrants only** | JUDGEMENT | IBTrACS writes 0 for "not reported"; averaging those in would shrink the storm. |
| W4 | Anchors whose speed is at or above the point's `vmax`, or whose radius is inside RMW, are **discarded** | JUDGEMENT | A decaying storm can report an R64 while its vmax has fallen below 64 kt. Keeping that anchor would make wind *rise* with distance. |
| W5 | A point with no usable outer radius contributes `vmax` inside RMW and zero beyond | JUDGEMENT | Conservative: the observation simply says nothing about the outer field. |
| W6 | Knots convert at 0.514444 m/s | SOURCED | Exact definition. |
| W7 | Distances are great-circle (haversine) on a sphere of radius 6371.0088 km | JUDGEMENT | IUGG mean radius. Ellipsoidal distance is unnecessary at this resolution. |
| W8 | Region geometry is reduced to a single **centroid** | JUDGEMENT | Per DR-4. Material simplification: a large prefecture is represented by one point, so a storm clipping its edge is under- or over-counted. Listed as a limitation in the README. |

## 5. Hazard — earthquake (DR-4)

| # | Assumption | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | MMI at a centroid is the **nearest** ShakeMap grid cell | JUDGEMENT | Per DR-4. No interpolation between cells. |
| E2 | The MMI column is located by its `grid_field` declaration, not by position | DERIVED | ShakeMap products vary in field count and order; MMI sits behind PGA in the Noto product. Assuming column 3 would read PGA as intensity. |

## 6. Vulnerability — wind (DR-5)

| # | Assumption | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | Emanuel (2011) sigmoid: `f = vn³/(1+vn³)`, `vn = max(V - 25.7, 0)/(V_half - 25.7)` | SOURCED | V in m/s, 1-minute sustained. |
| V2 | `V_half` = 190.5 m/s (JPN, TWN), 76.0 m/s (PHL) | SOURCED | Eberenz et al. 2021, CC BY 4.0. The single biggest driver of the PH/JP loss difference. |
| V3 | Per-country `calibration_factor`, default 1.0 | UNVERIFIED | Tuned in benchmark B5 and reported there. Until B5 runs, all factors are 1.0. |
| V4 | A damage ratio is capped at 1.0 after calibration | JUDGEMENT | A calibration factor must not produce a loss above the sum insured. |

## 7. Vulnerability — earthquake (DR-5)

| # | Assumption | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | MMI → mean damage ratio: 5 → 0, 6 → 0.5%, 7 → 2%, 8 → 6%, 9 → 15%, ≥10 → 30% | UNVERIFIED | **Illustrative.** Informed by Hazus damage-state repair ratios but not taken from them directly. `REQUIREMENTS.md` section 14.2 flags this. Must be labelled illustrative wherever displayed. |
| Q2 | Values are **interpolated linearly** between integer MMI anchors | JUDGEMENT | ShakeMap reports fractional MMI (6.7, not 7). At integer MMI the interpolated value equals the spec table exactly, so this refines the table rather than departing from it. Switchable via `interpolate: false`. |
| Q3 | Country factor 0.5 for JPN, 1.0 for TWN and PHL | UNVERIFIED | Reflects Japanese seismic building standards. Calibrated in B5. |

## 8. IBTrACS parsing (DR-3)

| # | Assumption | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | Row 2 is a **units row** and is skipped | SOURCED | IBTrACS v04r01 format. Detected by content (unparseable `ISO_TIME`) rather than by position alone, so a file without one still parses. |
| I2 | Storms are selected by **SID**, never by NAME | SOURCED | Names repeat across basins and seasons. |
| I3 | `USA_WIND` (1-minute, kt) is preferred | SOURCED | Matches the 1-minute basis Emanuel's function expects. |
| I4 | Where `USA_WIND` is absent, `TOKYO_WIND` (10-minute) x **1.12** | JUDGEMENT | 10-minute → 1-minute conversion. A commonly used factor, but a choice; it affects JMA-only track segments. |
| I5 | Missing values are blanks, bare spaces, `NA`, `NaN`, `-999` or `-9999` — never 0 | SOURCED | A 0 radius means "reported as zero", which differs from "not reported". |
| I6 | Radii are nautical miles, converted at 1.852 km | SOURCED | Exact definition. |
| I7 | Track points with no wind reading at all are **dropped** | JUDGEMENT | The point cannot contribute to a wind field. |
| I8 | Track points with no position are **dropped** | JUDGEMENT | As above. |

## 9. Synthetic portfolio (DR-1)

| # | Assumption | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| X1 | Region exposure weights are **approximate resident populations**, not GIROJ sums insured or e-Stat dwelling counts | JUDGEMENT | DR-1 asks for the latter two; we do not hold those datasets. Populations are public general knowledge and give a plausible distribution. The portfolio is synthetic by rule (C-8), so nothing downstream claims these are real exposure. Replacing them is a one-table change. **Benchmark B5 must not be run on these weights** — it uses a market-level proxy, which is a separate input. |
| X2 | All **22** ISO 3166-2:TW entries are carried | DERIVED | DR-1 says "21 counties/cities"; ISO lists 22. Carrying all 22 rather than dropping one to hit a number. |
| X3 | `TSI_PER_WEIGHT_USD_M = 15,000` | JUDGEMENT | Makes the synthetic Japanese market about **US$18.7tn** of sum insured — the right order for Japan, whose real insured value is order US$20–30tn — and puts Sakura at 14% share on about US$2.6tn. A round number chosen for that realism. |
| X4 | Market shares are **explicit per cedent**, not drawn from the seed | JUDGEMENT | A cedent's size is structural. If it moved with the seed, the demo's headline figures would move with it. Sakura is pinned at 14%. |
| X5 | The modelled Jebi gross loss for Sakura lands at **54.45** against the worked example's 54.40 | DERIVED | Falls out of X3 and X4 rather than being fitted. It is what lets the live demo reproduce the documented figures, and it is asserted by `test_the_jebi_replay_reproduces_the_worked_example_gross`. If `build_events.py`'s real IBTrACS track moves it, re-derive X3 once rather than loosening the test. |
| X6 | **The model under-predicts Jebi's actual market loss by roughly 25x** | UNVERIFIED | Jebi's paid claims were about ¥1,068bn (~US$9.5bn). The curve gives a market-wide damage ratio of ~0.00024 against a reality of ~0.0003–0.0005 — so the curve is roughly right at market level, but the modelled footprint only reaches 16 regions at low ratios, while real losses were broader and driven partly by flood and surge the model does not carry. **This is a B5 finding to report honestly, not something to tune away in the portfolio.** The lever is `calibration_factor` (V3), and it stays at 1.0 until B5 derives it. |
| X7 | Programmes are sized against a **reference major-event loss**, not against sum insured | JUDGEMENT | DR-1 asks for retentions "plausible relative to TSI", but a Cat XL is bought against a return-period loss. Sakura retains 10.0 of a 54.4 event — 18.4% of the event, and 0.0004% of its TSI, which is entirely normal for a cat cover. Every filler programme attaches in the same 15–35% band, so the book is internally coherent. |
| X8 | Each cedent's reference loss scales linearly with its sum insured from Sakura's | JUDGEMENT | Ignores that a Philippine book is far more wind-vulnerable than a Japanese one at the same wind speed. It only has to make the filler book's structure sensible, and it keeps the generator free of any dependency on the vulnerability curves. |
| X9 | Philippine earthquake penetration is **25%** of wind | JUDGEMENT | Reflects thin EQ take-up. Illustrative. |
| X10 | Region **centroids** are approximate, to about a tenth of a degree | JUDGEMENT | Committed so the hazard chain is testable and the demo runs without the ~40 MB Natural Earth download. `build_regions.py` recomputes them from Natural Earth 10m admin-1 polygons; a recomputed centroid more than ~50 km away is a reconciliation failure worth investigating. |

## 10. Treaty wordings (DR-2, FR-ENDORSE)

| # | Assumption | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Y1 | Wording prose is **original**, written in the register of catastrophe excess-of-loss contracts | DERIVED | RESEARCH_FINDINGS §D9 permits publicly filed wordings as a *style* reference only. Nothing is copied. Every document states on its face that it is synthetic, fictional and of no legal effect. |
| Y2 | Ground-truth **page numbers are read back out of the rendered PDF**, not predicted | DERIVED | QA-4 scores citation page accuracy at ≥ 95%, which is meaningless if the answer key's own pages were guessed. A layout change can no longer silently invalidate the key. |
| Y3 | The hours clause is phrased in **four registers** across the eight wordings | JUDGEMENT | `plain`, `spelled`, `period`, `words`. W8 carries it inside a definition with **no digits at all**. A single register would let a prompt tuned to one layout score 100%. |
| Y4 | **Ten decoy passages** mention a number of hours without being the hours clause | JUDGEMENT | Notification deadlines, cash-call windows, inspection notice, arbitration service, premium interest. They let QA-4 measure precision rather than recall alone. Each is recorded in the answer key, so a flag citing one scores as the false positive it is. |
| Y5 | **Boilerplate** clauses carry neither ground-truth fields nor decoy status | JUDGEMENT | Realistic noise — a real treaty is mostly boilerplate. Counting it either way would distort both recall and precision. It is also what brings each document honestly into DR-2's 6–15 page range rather than padding. |
| Y6 | The scanned endorsement sits on **W4** | JUDGEMENT | DR-2 does not pin W4's hours clause, so an override there adds a planted feature without contradicting the documented W1–W8 table — and it is not W1, whose terms the money moment depends on. |
| Y7 | The endorsement page has **no text layer** | DERIVED | Rendered as a raster image. Asserted by `test_the_endorsement_page_has_no_extractable_text`; the page yields under 120 characters, all of it the rendered footer. An endorsement the text extractor hands over for free exercises nothing. |
| Y8 | W4's **effective** windstorm hours window is 168, not the 72 its base clause states | DERIVED | FR-ENDORSE-3 makes the endorsement operative. The treaty record carries the effective term plus `endorsement{base_value, endorsed_value, source}` for provenance, and the answer key records both rows with distinct `source` values. |
| Y9 | **The "blind set" is a structural holdout, not a blind set** | JUDGEMENT | ⚠️ DR-2 and risk #5 in the win-readiness review ask for wordings written by someone **outside the prompt work**, so an accuracy score is not self-graded. This cannot be satisfied by the same author who writes the wordings, the answer key and the extraction prompts. What the generator produces is a holdout built from a different seed, ordering and phrasing — genuinely useful for catching a prompt tuned to one layout, and genuinely **not** a blind set. **Report it as a holdout. Never quote it as a blind-set score** until a human outside the prompt work has written one. |

## 11. Event replay files (DR-3)

| # | Assumption | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Z1 | **`duration_h` is the damaging window, not the track lifetime** | JUDGEMENT | The most consequential decision in `build_events.py`. Jebi's IBTrACS track spans **213 hours** from genesis to dissipation; using that as the duration would breach every hours clause and make the FR-WORD-1 flag fire on every replay, meaninglessly. The duration is the span of track points at which at least one in-scope region sees wind ≥ 25.7 m/s. |
| Z2 | The threshold is the **vulnerability curve's own** 25.7 m/s | DERIVED | Below it the Emanuel damage ratio is zero by construction, so those hours cannot contribute loss and therefore cannot lengthen a loss occurrence. Not an independently chosen number. |
| Z3 | Resulting durations: Jebi **9 h**, Haiyan **12 h**, Hagibis **27 h** | DERIVED | All comfortably inside a 72-hour clause, consistent with the DOMAIN_PRIMER's statement that Jebi's damage was "well inside 72". The primer says "about 24 hours"; the computed 9 h reflects 6-hourly track resolution over the covered regions. Both readings agree on what matters — no split. |
| Z4 | An earthquake's `duration_h` is **0** | JUDGEMENT | A mainshock is instantaneous, so no hours clause can split it. A real aftershock sequence would extend it; **not modelled.** Noto's 1 Jan 2024 sequence included substantial aftershocks, so a production system would need to decide whether they form one occurrence. |
| Z5 | MMI is **0 outside the ShakeMap grid extent** | DERIVED | Nearest-cell sampling always returns *something*. Unbounded, the Noto grid assigned MMI 2.9 to every Taiwanese and Philippine region — all band 0, so harmless to the loss, but they then appear in `event.regions`, and **FR-MATCH uses an event's regions to decide which treaties respond**. A Philippine treaty would have matched a Japanese earthquake. Bounds come from `grid_specification`, falling back **per key** to the cells' own extent. |
| Z6 | The ShakeMap grid URL is **resolved through the USGS event API**, not hardcoded | DERIVED | The download URL carries a product-version timestamp. Noto's ShakeMap is at version 10, so a pinned URL goes stale on the next revision. |
| Z7 | RESEARCH_FINDINGS records Noto's max MMI as 8.9; ShakeMap v10 gives **8.793** | SOURCED | The product has been revised since that note was written. The build takes the figure from the data, not the note. |
| Z8 | Facts and reference losses are **never model inputs** | DERIVED | Quoted from RESEARCH_FINDINGS §D8 for credibility and the B5 back-test only. Every event file carries that statement in its own `disclaimer` field, so the file cannot be read as claiming them as output. |
| Z9 | Source data is **cache-first, never fetched implicitly** | JUDGEMENT | The 114 MB CSV and 7.6 MB grid live in git-ignored `data/raw/`. A missing source fails with the exact URL and target path rather than producing a half-event; `--fetch` downloads explicitly. A zero-byte file counts as missing, because a truncated download is worse than an absent one. |

## 12. Ingestion and retrieval (FR-INGEST, S3 local half)

| # | Assumption | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Chunking is **by clause**, falling back to **by page** | DERIVED | FR-INGEST-2. Every flag cites a clause number and a page, and the verifier quote-matches against the stored chunk, so a chunk straddling two clauses can produce a quote that verifies against the chunk while citing the wrong clause — worse than failing, because it looks correct. |
| R2 | A clause is classified from its **heading**, not its body | JUDGEMENT | The heading is the drafter's own classification; body keywords are noise, and the decoys exploit exactly that. "Inspection of Records" mentions a period, "Loss Advices and Cash Calls" mentions a retention, "Definition: Business Day" mentions territory — a body-keyword classifier mistypes all three, and FR-WORD's retrieval would then pull them as material. |
| R3 | Structural headings (`Definitions`, `Endorsement`, `Schedule`, `Interpretation`) **defer to the body** | JUDGEMENT | They describe structure, not subject matter. This is what lets W8's operative hours clause — hidden inside a clause titled "Definitions" — and the scanned endorsement's override both classify correctly. |
| R4 | Body classification uses a **narrow phrase set**, not keywords | DERIVED | `consecutive hours` rather than `hours`. Every decoy says "within 72 hours of", "settle within 168 hours" and so on; **none** says "consecutive hours", which is the operative phrase in a loss-occurrence definition. That makes it a safe discriminator where a bare "hours" is not. |
| R5 | `clause_type` is a **filter of convenience, never a gate** | DERIVED | Retrieval ranks by vector similarity and uses `clause_type` only to reorder. Filtering hard on it would lose any clause whose heading does not advertise its subject. |
| R6 | A chunk **retains its own heading** in its text | JUDGEMENT | The heading is semantically informative, so it helps retrieval, and it is harmless to quote-matching. It also means a chunk body is never empty, which is why there is no empty-body guard. |
| R7 | An image-only page **without** a transcription is **skipped, not emitted empty** | JUDGEMENT | The caller is responsible for noticing: a silently dropped endorsement is how an override gets missed. A page yielding under 120 characters after furniture-stripping is treated as image-only; the scanned endorsement yields 45. |
| R8 | Local vectors are **768-dimensional**, matching production | DERIVED | C-2. Same shape locally and in production, so an index built on one is not silently incompatible with the other. |
| R9 | Vector pre-filters are **equality only** | SOURCED | C-11, a Firestore constraint. The interface therefore offers only `treaty_id`, so a query written against the in-memory store behaves identically against Firestore. |
| R10 | Ranking ties break on `chunk_id` | JUDGEMENT | Without it, equal scores reorder between runs and QA-5's ADK tool-trajectory check becomes flaky. |
| R11 | **`DeterministicEmbedder` has no semantics. Never quote a retrieval metric measured against it.** | JUDGEMENT | ⚠️ It is a hashing bag-of-words, so it matches on shared vocabulary and nothing else — "hours clause" and "loss occurrence" are the same concept and it scores them at zero (asserted by a test). It exists so chunking, retrieval, the tool contract and the QA harness can be built and tested without a model call. **Recall and precision figures for the deck come from `GeminiEmbedder` against a live Firestore index and from nowhere else.** |
| R12 | QA-3 comparison is **typed, not textual** | JUDGEMENT | `"72"`, `72` and `72.0` are the same hours clause; `["WS","EQ"]` and `["EQ","WS"]` are the same peril list. A string compare fails all of these and reports an accuracy far below the truth — the sort of error that gets a threshold loosened when the extractor was right. Coercion is narrow: a scalar never matches a list, and booleans never compare as numbers. |
| R13 | A field **absent** from an extraction counts as **wrong**, not skipped | JUDGEMENT | Otherwise omitting the hard fields is the easiest route to a high score. |
| R14 | Citation pages are scored **separately** from field values | DERIVED | QA-4 scores page accuracy at ≥ 95% on its own line. A field extracted correctly but cited to the wrong page is a different failure: the number is right and the audit trail is wrong, which in a regulated setting is arguably worse. Averaging the two would hide both. |
| R15 | Transcription reads are reported **separately** from text-layer reads | DERIVED | At two transcription fields out of 186, a uniform average would hide a total failure to read the scan. A model that reads clean text well and scans badly has a very different weakness from one that is uniformly mediocre. |
| R16 | Each field is claimed on **exactly one page** in the answer key | DERIVED | A field claimed on two pages cannot be cited correctly, which makes QA-4's page accuracy unscoreable for it. W8 originally did this — its hours clause appeared in both Clause 5 and the Definitions clause — so Clause 5 now cross-references rather than restating. Asserted by a test. |

## 13. Citation verification (FR-VERIFY, QA-10)

| # | Assumption | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| VF1 | Verification is scoped to the **cited location**: treaty, then clause, then page | JUDGEMENT | A quote that exists somewhere in the corpus is not verified; it must exist where the citation says. This is what makes the badge `verified - {treaty}, p.{page}, cl.{clause}` something an analyst can check by turning to the page. |
| VF2 | A clause spanning a page break verifies on **any** page it spans | JUDGEMENT | Via `pages_spanned`. Refusing a citation to page 4 of a clause that starts on page 3 would be a false withhold. |
| VF3 | **Boilerplate text cannot detect a wrong-treaty citation** | DERIVED | All eight wordings share 11 boilerplate clauses, so a quote from W1's Schedule clause genuinely appears in W2 - citing it to W2 is not an error to catch, because it is not an error. QA-10's wrong-treaty corruption is therefore built only from treaty-unique text, which is also what a real flag cites: the operative clause, never the furniture. Found while writing QA-10, not predicted. |
| VF4 | Mid-word truncation fails deterministically; a **clean** partial quote does not | JUDGEMENT | A cut quote cannot be checked against the page, so word-boundary alignment is enforced. But a clean, genuinely present, misleadingly partial quote **is** a substring and must pass FR-VERIFY-1 - catching the misleading omission is FR-VERIFY-2's job. Cheap checks first, the model only on what survives. |
| VF5 | The chunk's own `source` is authoritative for the badge, not the citation's claim | JUDGEMENT | QA-12 needs `verified against transcription` to be true of the stored chunk. What the model asserts about provenance is not load-bearing. |
| VF6 | Normalisation undoes what `pypdf` mangles and nothing more | JUDGEMENT | NFKC (ligatures), curly quotes, en/em dashes, soft hyphens, zero-width characters, hyphenated line breaks, whitespace collapse, casefold. Punctuation is **not** stripped wholesale: "not, covered" must not match "not covered", and "shall not apply" must not match "shall apply". |
| VF7 | No FR-VERIFY-2 number exists yet | UNVERIFIED | The semantic check needs `MODEL_REASON`. Every `semantic_pass` in the local suite comes from a stub (`AlwaysSupports`), so **QA-10's result covers the deterministic half only**. The semantic half cannot be measured until the models resolve on a real project. Same class of gap as R11. |

## 14. Data sources and licences (DR-6)

| Source | Use | Licence |

Portfolio, cedents and treaty wordings are **entirely synthetic**. Events are
real, and the referenced market losses are real; those are used for
credibility and the B5 back-test only, **never as model inputs**.

## 15. Outstanding — to validate, not blocking

1. `calibration_factor` (V3) and the EQ country factors (Q3) are 1.0 / 0.5 placeholders until B5 runs. Calibrate on one event, test on the other, and report misses honestly.
2. The EQ MMI table (Q1) should be checked against published Hazus repair ratios before it is cited as anything but illustrative.
3. The 10-minute to 1-minute wind factor (I4) deserves a source rather than convention.
4. Centroid representation (W8) is the largest structural simplification in the hazard chain. Quantify its effect on at least one event before claiming regional accuracy.
5. Baseline manual-effort figures are hypotheses until the B1 run.
6. The portfolio exposure weights (X1) should be rebuilt on GIROJ and e-Stat figures before any claim about regional accuracy is made.
7. X6 is the single most important honest disclosure in the proof pack: report the under-prediction and the calibration separately.
8. **R11 is the third: no retrieval quality number exists yet.** Chunking, ranking and the QA harness are tested; the embedder they are tested against is not semantic. Nothing about recall, precision or extraction accuracy can be reported until `GeminiEmbedder` runs against a live index.
9. Z4: decide whether Noto's aftershock sequence should form one occurrence or several before the earthquake path is presented as complete.
10. **Y9 is the second: the holdout set is not a blind set.** A human outside the prompt work needs to write three wordings with planted issues the prompt author never sees. Until then, the holdout score is reported as a holdout score.
11. **VF7: QA-10's result is the deterministic half only.** Every `semantic_pass` in the suite comes from a stub, so the FR-VERIFY-2 check is unmeasured. Report QA-10 as "100% of mechanically corrupted citations withheld, 0 false withholds" - which is what was tested - and not as citation accuracy in general.
